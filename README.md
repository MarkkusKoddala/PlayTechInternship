# Internship Task - File Processing

## Overview
This repository contains Markkus Koddala's internship task for file processing. The task involves reading data from `match_data.txt` and `player_data.txt` files located in the `resource` folder and generating an output file named `output.txt` in the `source` folder.

## File Structure
- `resource/`: Contains input files.
  - `match_data.txt`: File containing match data.
  - `player_data.txt`: File containing player data.
- `source/`: Output folder where the `output.txt` file will be generated.

## Task Requirements
- Ensure `match_data.txt` and `player_data.txt` files are placed within the `resource` folder.
- The program reads data from these files and processes it accordingly.
- An `output.txt` file is created in the `source` folder based on the processed data.

## Running the Program
Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
Run the program from an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) by executing the `Main.java` file, which contains the main method.

## Instructions
1. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
2. Locate and open the `Main.java` file.
3. Run the `Main.java` file, which contains the `main` method.
4. Verify the output in the `source/output.txt` file within the project directory.

## Note
- Executing the program from the command line might require adjustments to file paths. For ease of use and correct path resolution, it's recommended to run the program from an IDE.
- Make sure the project structure and file paths are correctly configured within the IDE for proper execution.
