# Internship Task - File Processing

## Overview
This repository contains Markkus Koddala's internship task for file processing. The task involves reading data from `match_data.txt` and `player_data.txt` files located in the `resource` folder and generating an output file named `output.txt` in the `source` folder.

## File Structure
- `resource/`: Contains input files.
  - `match_data.txt`: File containing match data.
  - `player_data.txt`: File containing player data.
- `source/`: Output folder where the `output.txt` file will be generated.

## Task Requirements
- Ensure `match_data.txt` and `player_data.txt` files are placed within the `resource` folder.
- The program will read data from these files and process it accordingly.
- An `output.txt` file will be created in the `source` folder based on the processed data.

## Running the Program
1. Ensure Java is installed on your system.
2. Compile and run the `Main.java` file, which contains the main method.
    ```bash
    javac Main.java
    java Main
    ```
3. Check the `source/output.txt` file for the generated output.

## Note
- Make sure to configure the file paths properly in the Java code to match your directory structure.
